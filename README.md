# NationStates-Recruiter
A simple recruitment-telegram sender for NationStates, by Pekares

Sends telegrams to new nations

You write in your client key, telegram id, and secret key as input when you have run the program.
Should recuire Python 3

Errors:
Since the whole program (basically) is within a try statement, the program will not exit with errors.
Instead it will run over and over again, trying and trying.
So,
If the program doesn't send a telegram in 10 seconds since you started it, check your input
If the program isn't sending telegrams anymore but have done, please contact me. There
might be several errors I haven't thought about.
